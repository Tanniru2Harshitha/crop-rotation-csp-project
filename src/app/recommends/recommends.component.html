        <p class="para">Crop rotation is a farming technique where crops are planted in different plots of land every year. The practice is to maximize healthy soil, ensure strong crop growth, and reduce the probability of a weed or pest infestation. If a farmer plants sweet corn in the field, after the harvest he will rotate the crops and plant something else in the field. Sweet corn is used in this example, a new crop might be beans. Where corn takes up a lot of nitrogen as it grows, beans are considered good for nitrogen-fixing. When deciding on a rotation plan, it might be complex involving many crops or just a simple strategy with two or three crop rotations.Plants and crops grown have varied nutritional differences and need certain nutrients to grow. There are also some crops that are more susceptible to pest or weed infestation. Usually, in traditional farming methods, the same crops are planted on the same patch of land each year. When this is the case, the soil loses its nutrients over time. This makes it a more hospitable environment for disease to grow or pests to make their home. As these monocultures increase, using more pesticides and chemical fertilizers is needed to control the problem.</p>
        <p class="para">Organic matter is kept by farming with green manure crops, municipal sewage sludge, and sod crops. The result was increased soil fertility with lower erosion rates. The organic matter content was also higher.In Virginia, a four-year rotation that used no-till practices prompted research. By fall, a cover crop of rye and hairy vetch followed tillage. The cover crop showed some success for weed control.Crop rotation is an important concept that is imperative for organic farms using sustainable agriculture. Disease prevention on organic farms is reliant on crop rotations. Its similarly helpful for the management of weeds.Production of organic crops relies on nutrients released from organic matter found in healthy soil, green manure</p>
