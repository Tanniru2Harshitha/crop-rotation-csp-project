  <h2>Impacts</h2>
    <p>
        Crop rotation is a farming practice that involves growing different crops in a specific sequence on the same piece of land over a period of time. This practice has several positive impacts on agricultural productivity, soil health, pest and disease control, and sustainability. Here are some of the key impacts of crop rotation:<br>
        1. Enhanced Soil Fertility: Crop rotation helps to maintain and improve soil fertility. Different crops have different nutrient requirements, and rotating crops helps prevent the depletion of specific nutrients from the soil. For example, leguminous crops like peas or beans have nitrogen-fixing properties, which enrich the soil with nitrogen, benefiting subsequent crops that require this nutrient.<br>
        2. Reduced Soil Erosion: By alternating crops with different root structures and growth habits, crop rotation helps reduce soil erosion. Deep-rooted crops, such as corn or winter cover crops, help to anchor the soil and prevent erosion, especially in areas prone to wind or water erosion.<br>
        3. Pest and Disease Control: Crop rotation can disrupt the life cycles of pests, pathogens, and weeds. Different crops attract different pests and diseases, so rotating crops makes it harder for these organisms to build up populations. Additionally, some crops can release natural compounds into the soil that inhibit the growth of specific pests and diseases, reducing the need for chemical interventions.<br>
        4. Weed Suppression: Crop rotation can help control weeds by breaking the weed life cycle. Different crops may require different weed management strategies, and rotating crops disrupts the weed growth pattern. For instance, crops with dense canopies can suppress weed growth by shading and outcompeting them.<br>
        5. Improved Water Management: Crop rotation can have positive effects on water management. Some crops have deep root systems that help improve water infiltration and drainage, reducing the risk of waterlogging. Alternating crops with different water requirements can also help optimize water usage.<br>
        6. Enhanced Biodiversity: Crop rotation promotes biodiversity by creating a more diverse habitat for beneficial insects, birds, and soil microorganisms. Different crops provide different food sources and habitats, supporting a wider range of organisms that contribute to pest control and soil health.<br>
        7. Sustainable Farming Practices: By reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides, crop rotation supports more sustainable farming practices. It can help decrease input costs, minimize chemical runoff into water bodies, and reduce the risk of developing resistance in pests and diseases.<br>
        Overall, crop rotation is a valuable agricultural practice that offers multiple benefits for farmers and the environment.<br>
        It helps maintain soil health, manage pests and diseases, conserve water, and promote sustainable and resilient farming systems.<br>
        Crop rotation and soil tillage are among key factors impacting cropping system productivity, pest management and soil health.<br>
        To assess their role in northern cropping systems, we quantified the effects of crop rotation on spring wheat yield in different tillage systems based on a long-term field experiment in southwestern Finland.<br>
        In addition, effects of crop rotation on weeds, plant pathogens, and pest insects were assessed. <br>
        Three types of crop rotation were compared: monoculture (spring wheat), 2-year rotation (spring wheat—turnip rape—spring wheat—barley) and 4-year rotation (spring wheat—turnip rape—barley—pea) under no-tillage and plowing.<br>
        A diversified crop rotation improved spring wheat yield by up to 30% in no-tillage and by 13% under plowing compared with monoculture. Overall, the yield quantity and quality differences between crop rotations were higher in no-tillage plots than in plowed plots.<br>
        The occurrence of weed species in spring wheat before herbicide control was highest in the four-year crop rotation and lowest in the wheat monoculture.<br>
        For plant diseases, wheat leaf blotch disease severity, mainly caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, was lowest in the most diverse crop rotation. On average, wheat leaf blotch disease severity was 20% less when wheat was grown every fourth year compared with wheat monoculture.<br>
        The effect of crop rotation on stem and root diseases became apparent after 6 years of rotation and the disease index was lowest in the most diverse crop rotation.<br>
        Neither rotation nor tillage affected the control need of wheat midge (Sitodiplosis mosellana).<br>
        Based on our results, diverse crop rotations including cereals, oilseed crops, and legumes increase yield and reduce plant disease severity of spring wheat in Finland, with the magnitude being larger in no-tillage systems.
